In order to port the core module to a new platform, it is highly recommended to build the unit tests projects one after another.
This will help you deal with only one problem at a time. The proper order of porting for unit tests in this module is:
- log
- assert

Please read the corresponding readme file inside each test's documentation to verify the expected behavior of each test.
