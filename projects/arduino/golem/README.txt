GOLEM

Project based on the Arduino Mega Board, using the libraries of the REV sdk.
It's basically a remote execution server. Arduino recieves command packets over the serial port, executes them, and returns the results (if any).
This allows a PC side client to control it remotely, transfering commands in real time for rapid prototyping.

It's named GOLEM because in this project the arduino board doesn't seem to have a "soul". It shows no initiative or objectives, it just follows
the orders of an external entity. Just like Golem, it becomes a soulless tool.
