// Managed resources

Rev SDK uses the concept of Resource for objects whose life time is controlled by reference counting.
Managed resources are those resources that are usually handled by a manager that associates them
to a unique key.

To create a managed resource class, you must inherit from the template class ManagedResource,
using your own class (tha child class that inherits from ManagedResource) as the first template
parameter, the class of the desired associative key as the second parameter, and a boolean
indicating wether the class features a factory method (more on that later) as the third parameter.

The factory method is a static method of the child class that will be called to try to create an object
given a key, whenever the manager can't find the requested object.

Example:

class ManagedBar : ManagedResource<ManagedBar, string, true>
{
	static ManagedBar* factory(const string&);
};
